## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#3498DB), echoing the grand scale of the league, while avoiding clichés like using sports greens.
- Background color: Light-sky-blue (#ECF0F1). Visibly related to the primary color, desaturated, and with a bright appearance.
- Accent color: Medium blue (#2980B9), an analogous color used for strong contrast.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a techy and modern feel; body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer text blocks.
- Crisp, vector-based icons for teams, players, and match events.
- A dynamic, responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance user engagement.
